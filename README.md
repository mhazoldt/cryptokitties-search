## Libraries Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) to dynamically load content with performance optimizations.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage application state.
- [Thunks](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to do AJAX API calls with Redux.
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for fancy animations.
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for CSS.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) utility CSS classes only to easily place elements using the padding/margin classes.
